# 💻 Personal Profile – HTML Task

## 📚 Task Description

This is a **personal profile web page** created using **only HTML** as part of an assignment from the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**.

The page presents my background, skills, interests, and includes a contact form. It demonstrates use of core HTML elements taught in the sessions, as well as several **new HTML features** that I researched and added independently.
